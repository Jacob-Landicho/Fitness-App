## Description

This prototype fitness application allows the user to add ``meals`` and ``activities`` to their daily schedule. <br /><br />
This app also tracks the amount of ``calories burned`` and ``steps taken`` with the user being able to set their ``goals`` along with other ``profile information``. <br /><br />
Additionally, the user can create their own profile that is stored in ``Google Firebase`` so they can sign in later on with the same credentials. <br /><br />
